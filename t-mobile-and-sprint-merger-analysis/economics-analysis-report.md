# Report on the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint
## 1.	Introduction
T-Mobile US, Inc., and Sprint Corporation have filed applications pursuant seeking Commission consent to transfer of control of the licenses, authorizations and spectrum leases held by Sprint and its subsidiaries to T-Mobile in furtherance of T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s previously announced agreement to merge. The merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, two prominent entities in the telecommunications industry, has undergone rigorous scrutiny within the framework of antitrust regulations. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of this antitrust merger case, delving into critical aspects such as the industry landscape, relevant markets, the business nature of the involved parties, the basic features of the antitrust proceedings, and implementing economic analysis on this antitrust case. Understanding the context and implications of this case is essential, as it represents a pivotal moment in the telecommunications sector, with potential ramifications for market competition, consumer welfare, and the overall structure of the industry.
### 1.1 Industry and Relevant Markets
The telecommunications industry, characterized by its dynamic nature and constant technological evolution, plays a fundamental role in shaping modern communication and connectivity. The case primarily centers on wireless telecommunications services, specifically mobile voice, and data services, and involves an exploration of the competitive dynamics within this space.
Before the merger, T-Mobile and Sprint were among the four major wireless carriers in the United States, alongside Verizon and AT&T. The consolidation of T-Mobile and Sprint raises questions about the number of competitors in the relevant market, the barriers to entry, and the potential impacts on market homogeneity or differentiation.
The barrier to entry in the telecommunications industry is considered significant due to the substantial infrastructure and capital requirements for establishing and maintaining a nationwide network.
### 1.2 Business Nature of Parties Involved
T-Mobile is a publicly-traded Delaware corporation controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche Telekom).  It is a major wireless telecommunications carrier that provides a range of services, including mobile voice, data, and messaging. As T-Mobile states in documents, it is the third largest provider of postpaid service plans and the largest provider of prepaid service plans in the U.S., serving approximately 79.7 million postpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers.  T-Mobile has positioned itself as a disruptive force in the telecommunications industry, challenging traditional norms and seeking to differentiate itself from competitors. It has often focused on consumer-friendly initiatives, such as eliminating certain fees and offering unlimited data plans. 
Sprint is a publicly-traded Delaware corporation controlled by SoftBank Group Corp. (SoftBank).  Sprint has historically been recognized for its extensive network coverage. As Sprint states in the document that it “offers a range of wireless and wireline voice and data products and services, as well as devices and accessories, to residential and business customers in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands under the Sprint, Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, and Assurance Wireless brands,” and that it “is the fourth-largest wireless carrier in the U.S., serving approximately 54.5 million postpaid, prepaid, and wholesale customers”. 
### 1.3 Basic Features of the Antitrust Case
The proposed merger was announced in April 2018 and faced regulatory scrutiny from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The central issue in the antitrust case was whether the merger would substantially lessen competition in the relevant market. Concerns were raised about the potential negative impact on consumer choice, pricing, and innovation. The case garnered significant attention due to its potential to reshape the competitive landscape of the telecommunications industry. Regulatory approval or denial would have profound implications for market dynamics, affecting both consumers and industry stakeholders.
## 2.	Literature Review
Tyrone Branch (2019)  focuses on the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, aiming to research and document the agreement between the two wireless networks to form a single entity. He stated that the primary motivation for the merger is to gain market share and expand into new business segments, with the goal of pleasing shareholders and the merger is seen as a strategic alliance that will benefit both carriers and allow them to learn from each other. 
As economists with significant experience in competition and regulatory matters Economides et. al., (2019)  offer comments on the remedies proposed by the Department of Justice to address the competitive effects flowing from the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, as recognized by the DOJ’s Complaint. By eliminating Sprint as an independent competitor, the Sprint/T-Mobile merger, even in the presence of DOJ’s proposed remedy, would inflict serious antitrust injury on consumers and competition. The assertion made by Economides et. al. (2019) emphasizes skepticisharmarding the efficacy of the Proposed Final Judgment in addressing the anticompetitive harms outlined in the Complaint. The argument posits that the remedy falls short of restoring the competitive conditions in the antitrust product markets as they existed prior to the merger. Additionally, the text questions the viability of DISH's Mobile Network Operator (MNO) model, highlighting that both the DOJ and the FCC have not recognized it as a substantial competitive constraint on facilities-based providers. The concern extends to DISH's reliance on New T-Mobile for network and operational support, raising issues of ongoing entanglements between the divestiture buyer and the merged company, a situation deemed problematic by regulatory authorities. Furthermore, the skepticism extends to DISH's commitment to building a 5G network covering 70 percent of the population, with doubts about its capability to replace Sprint, which currently has a more extensive reach, encompassing over 90 percent of Americans.
As economists with significant experience in competition, telecommunications, and regulatory matters, Economides et. al., (2020)  have filed the attached brief in the case of State of New York v. Deutsche Telecom supporting the plaintiffs, who have sued to prevent the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. They explain why the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile and the elimination of Sprint as a competitor, even in the presence of the U.S. Department of Justice's proposed remedy (as embodied in the DOJ's Proposed Final Judgment), would predictably inflict serious antitrust injury on consumers and competition.  Following up on the initial comments at the Tunney Act proceeding of the proposed merger between Sprint and T-Mobile they discuss DOJ’s criticisms of these comments, explaining why these criticisms are baseless. Using evidence from the NY v. Deutsche Telecom trial, they provide new arguments showing that the DOJ proposed remedy will fail to restore the ex-ante competitive conditions in the affected antitrust product markets to the detriment of users of mobile phones in the United States. There have been press reports that the head of the Antitrust Division lobbied members of Congress in connection with the settlement of the Sprint-T–Mobile merger investigation and personally sought to broker the divestiture that was accepted to allow the transaction to move forward.
John A. & Micheal L, (2022)  discusses the proposed merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, which involved the transfer of spectrum licenses and was subject to review by antitrust agencies and public utilities regulators at both state and federal levels, and they also highlights the role of the structural presumption and the prediction of coordinated effects in the trial, as well as the conditions and settlements that led to the approval of the merger.
## 3.	Court Document Review
As known to all, a merger case requires the regulatory approval process involving regulatory agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), mainly to ensure that mergers will not lead to unfair competition and monopoly. Usually, the approval process includes 8 steps: filing and preliminary review, detailed review, competition analysis, definition of product and service markets, geographical market analysis, potential impacts of the merger, negotiation and remedies, and approval or block. This case has garnered significant attention, and this report will focus mainly on the timeline of the approval process, the complaints of the case and responses from the defendant, and the commitments made by the applicants to gain approval.
### 3.1 Court Timeline
T-Mobile and Sprint filed their applications on June 18, 2018. On July 18, 2018, the Commission released a Public Notice accepting the applications for filing and establishing a pleading cycle for public comments.
On September 11, 2018, the Commission paused its informal 180-day transaction shot clock to allow Commission staff and third parties to review newly submitted modeling relied upon by T-Mobile and Sprint. According to the Commission, each of the three separate developments requires more time. First, the applicants submitted a substantially revised network engineering model and the newly provided network engineering model is significantly larger and more complex than the one in the record. Second, in an ex parte meeting, T-Mobile executives described T-Mobile’s reliance on a business model titled Build 9, which apparently provides the financial basis for the projected new network buildout, but the Commission did not receive, and no third parties have access to it. Third, T-Mobile recently disclosed that it intends to submit additional economic modeling in support of the applications. All these above require additional time for review. So, the clock paused to wait for new material submissions and review.
Subsequently, on November 13, 2018, the commission issued a Public Notice seeking comment on a new econometric study, which relied on a new data set and new methodologies, submitted by T-Mobile and Sprint. This Public Notice requested comments on the new econometric study, that was due by December 4, 2018.And the clock did resume on that day.
The Applicants subsequently filed significant additional information regarding their network integration plans for 2019-2021, an extension of their previously filed merger simulation 1, and additional information regarding their claims related to fixed wireless broadband services on February 21 and March 6, 2019.
As a result, the Commission paused the clock on March 7, 2019, and provided an opportunity for interested parties to file comments on these new submissions. The Commission also stated that absent further significant new record submissions by the applicants or other outstanding issues, the clock would resume on April 4, and the clock did resume on that date.
Until then, all the materials submitted have passed the review and waited for an approval or block. And finally, on Oct 16, 2019, Federal Communication Committee approves T-Mobile and Sprint transaction with conditions.
### 3.2 Potential public interest harms: Unilateral and Coordinated Effects
During the proceedings, both the commission and the public expressed concerns regarding potential harm. The commission placed significant emphasis on the unilateral effects and coordinated effects of proposed transaction.
Unilateral Effects
For unilateral effects, Horizontal transactions raise potential competitive concerns when the combined entity has the incentive and the ability to raise prices, lower quality, or otherwise harm competition in a relevant market. And the Commission shed lights on consumer substitution, gross upward pricing pressure analysis and predicted price effects.
For consumer substitution, the degree of direct competition or substitution between the merging parties’ products and whether there are non-merging parties that are selling close substitutes are important factors in determining the likelihood and magnitude of any potential unilateral price. The Applicants tried to prove that the consumer substitution between T-Mobile and Sprint is not of a high degree by claiming that LNP porting data are unreliable for purposes of calculating diversion ratios and will exaggerate the closeness of competition between the two merging parties. However, the Commission justified that the LNP porting data is imperfect but still the most reliable proxy.
The Gross Upward Pricing Pressure Index (GUPPI) has been previously used by the Commission as a measure of the competitive constraint that merging parties exert on each other. Petitioners argue that the proposed transaction would likely lead to significant upward pricing pressure based on results of a GUPPI analysis. But the Applicants did not submit a GUPPI analysis with their filings and even do not directly respond to opponent’s GUPPI analyses. Staff conducted an upward pricing pressure analysis, using data submitted by the Applicants. The GUPPIs that staff estimated predicted whether the proposed transaction without conditions is likely to raise prices.
When it comes to Merger Simulation and Predicted Price Effects, Both the Applicants and DISH submitted merger simulations. DISH asserts that its model demonstrates that the proposed transaction would result in higher prices while the Applicants assert their simulation a procompetitive result. Therefore, the Commission did a simulation themselves and they predict it is likely that there would be harmful price effects for the transaction without conditions. And they ultimately conclude that the divestiture of Boost Mobile is necessary to ensure that the transaction will not substantially lessen competition.
Coordinated Effects
It is said that coordination between two competing companies will harm the market by raising the price, lowering the quality or something else. The Applicants contend that coordination would be less likely post transaction. Broadly speaking, the Applicants’ assert that: (1) dynamic demand incentivizes maverick (non-coordinating) behavior; and (2) network investment competition incentivizes deviating from any coordination scheme. The Commission does not conclude that the likelihood of coordination would increase post transaction. But they did require some commitments from the applicants to lessen their worries about the anticompetitive effect.
### 3.3 Commitments to gain approval
First, Boost Mobile divestitures. Regarding the potential impact of the transaction on competition, the Applicants pledged to divest Sprint’s Boost Mobile business, including Boost’s stores, employees, and current subscribers, to an independent buyer DISH network, as well as to provide the buyer a wholesale agreement with rates and terms that “will ensure that New Boost will be an aggressive competitor.” DISH Network was designated as a new wireless carrier intended to replace Sprint as a competitor. T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to sell certain spectrum licenses, prepaid businesses, and other assets to DISH Network to enable it to establish its wireless network. And to prevent anticompetitive coordination between T-Mobile and DISH Network, the conditions included measures to ensure that the two companies operate independently. These three agreements ensure that the new T-Mobile will maintain DISH as the fourth greatest wireless company in US, taking the place of the old Sprint, in order to make the market as competitive as before.
And then comes to the Coverage and Deployment Commitments and Pricing Commitments to ensure the consumers’ product quality. T-Mobile committed to expanding its 5G network coverage, especially in rural areas. The FCC imposed specific requirements for the deployment of 5G infrastructure to ensure that the merger benefits consumers with improved wireless services and to offer certain pricing plans to consumers for a specified period. These commitments were made to address concerns about potential negative impacts on pricing resulting from reduced competition.
## 4.	Economic Analysis
The T-Mobile and Sprint merger presents a complex economic landscape with both procompetitive and anticompetitive implications. On the procompetitive side, the merger holds the potential for efficiency gains through the consolidation of resources, economies of scale, and accelerated deployment of advanced technologies such as 5G. This could result in improved service quality, expanded network coverage, and enhanced innovation.
However, anticompetitive concerns arise due to the reduction in the number of major competitors from four to three, which may lead to decreased market competition. This reduction could potentially result in higher prices for consumers, reduced incentives for quality improvements, and fewer choices in the telecommunications market.
Efficiency Gains:
The merger can lead to efficiency gains through the integration of T-Mobile's and Sprint's resources, including network infrastructure, spectrum assets, and operational capabilities. Economies of scale may reduce operating costs and enhance the new entity's ability to invest in technological advancements.
Theories of Harms:
The main theory of harm lies in the potential for reduced competition. A consolidated market may decrease incentives for the merged entity to offer competitive pricing and innovative services. The diminished competitive pressure could result in a slowdown of technological advancements and less favorable outcomes for consumers.
Impact on Market Competition:
The reduction in the number of major competitors raises concerns about the impact on market competition. A consolidated market may result in decreased rivalry, potentially leading to oligopolistic pricing behavior and reduced consumer welfare.
Given the complexity of the case, a balanced approach is essential. While the merger may generate efficiency gains and accelerate technological advancements, the potential reduction in competition raises significant concerns. The Department of Justice (DOJ) should carefully weigh the benefits against the potential harms and consider imposing conditions that mitigate anticompetitive effects.
## 5.	Limitation and Potential Concern
First, the analysis is limited by the lack of empirical data, making it challenging to quantify the specific impacts on competition, pricing, and consumer welfare. Second, the long-term effects of the merger are uncertain, and the analysis relies on assumptions about the behavior of the merged entity, DISH's ability to replace Sprint, and the regulatory oversight's effectiveness. Third, the telecommunications market is dynamic, and factors such as technological advancements, consumer preferences, and competitive responses may evolve over time, introducing additional uncertainties.
## 6.	Conclusion
In conclusion, the T-Mobile and Sprint merger represents a pivotal moment in the telecommunications industry. The literature review emphasizes the historical context and existing knowledge surrounding such mergers, while the court document review sheds light on the regulatory framework and conditions imposed. The economic analysis provides insights into the expected benefits and potential drawbacks, and the section on limitations and concerns highlights areas that warrant ongoing attention. In summary, the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint was a multifaceted and intricate case encompassing legal, economic, and regulatory dimensions. It set the stage for future mergers in the telecommunications industry, underscoring the necessity to carefully balance market concentration, competitive forces, economic growth, and consumer well-being. The ultimate impact of the merger on consumers, competitors, and the economic landscape of the industry is contingent on the actions taken by the merged entity and the ongoing regulatory oversight. Consequently, this case serves as a compelling case study in antitrust regulation and economic analysis within the telecommunications sector. As the industry continues to evolve, monitoring the outcomes of this merger will be crucial to understanding its broader implications for competition, innovation, and consumer welfare.
